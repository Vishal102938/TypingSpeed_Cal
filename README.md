⌨️ Typing Speed Calculator in Python
💡 Project Overview:

I created a Typing Speed Calculator using Python that measures a user's typing speed in words per second and also calculates the number of mistakes made while typing.
This is a console-based application designed to help users test and improve their typing skills. It selects a random sentence, records the time taken to type it, and provides feedback on typing speed and accuracy.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

Language: Python
Modules:
1. time — to calculate typing duration
2. random — to randomly select sentences from a list

🧠 How It Works:

1. The program asks the user if they’re ready to begin the typing test.
2. If the user types “yes”, it randomly picks a sentence from a predefined list.
3. The user is shown the sentence and asked to type it as quickly and accurately as possible.
   
The program:

1. Records the time before and after typing.
2. Calculates typing speed (words per second).
3. Compares the user's input with the original sentence.
4. Counts and displays the number of errors (wrong or missing characters).
5. The user can choose to retake the test or exit the program.

📌 Key Features:

✅ Random Sentence Selection
Each test feels different because the program chooses from a set of pre-written sentences.

✅ Typing Speed Calculation
Uses time() to measure how long the user takes and calculates typing speed using a simple formula:

Speed = Total characters typed / Time taken (in seconds)

✅ Mistake Counter
The program checks each character and counts how many characters were incorrect or missing.

✅ Continuous Testing Loop
After each round, the user can choose to test again or exit — making it interactive and user-friendly.

📚 What I Learned:

This project helped me practice and strengthen the following concepts:

Working with Python’s built-in libraries (time and random)

Using functions to separate logic (speed calculation, mistake detection)

Error handling using try-except blocks

Building interactive console applications

Understanding user input handling and string comparison

🔄 Possible Future Enhancements:

Here are some features I’m considering adding:

Words per minute (WPM) instead of words per second

GUI version using Tkinter for better user experience

Custom sentence input so users can test with their own text

Accuracy percentage

Leaderboard system to track top scores or improvements over time

Improved text comparison (word-level rather than character-level)

🙌 Final Thoughts:

1. This project was a fun and rewarding way to practice Python basics in a hands-on way. It’s a perfect example of how simple logic can be turned into an interactive and useful tool.
2.If you’re learning Python or building beginner projects, I’d highly recommend trying something like this — it's a great way to improve both your coding and problem-solving skills!
